                <p>Hello World,</p>
                <p>My name is Abd Alla Ibrahim, or Omar for short. I am an aspiring web developer and I/O Psychologist. I graduated as a Cum Laude from North Carolina State University with a Bachelors in Psychology, and I am currently in the UNC-Chapel Hill coding bootcamp. I have enjoyed the bootcamp because I learned a lot about the basics of web development and this bootcamp has given me a greater appreciation for the websites I use and the new websites that are made every day. The course has been challenging in many ways, but I enjoy such challenges. By the end of my training at the UNC Bootcamp, I hope I can get a full-time job as web developer so I can better understand the work environment and standards in the industry.
